    "##### 1.1 Origins of the data\n",
    "Fisher’s Iris data set, is a multivariate data set that was introduced by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. <br>The data was collected by Edgar Anderson to quantify the morphologic variation of three related Iris flower species. Fisher utilised the data to demonstrate the use of linear discriminant analysis in his 1936 paper, published in the Annals of Eugenics; “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”.\n",
    "<br>In recent times, the dataset is often used as a typical test case for statistical classification in machine learning.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.2 Contents of the Iris dataset \n",
    "The Iris dataset contains 50 samples of three different Iris flower species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. Each sample has four features measured in centimetres: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. Using these four sets of data, Ronald Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to differentiate between the species.<br>\n",
