# List

And Saint Attila raised his holy list up on high, saying, "O Lord, bless this Thy sacred list that, with it, Thou mayest organize thy tasks into Tiny groups of three in Thy mercy." And the Lord did grin, and the people did plan their tasks: one, two, three. No more, no less. Three was the number they counted, and the counting of tasks shall be three.

They shall not count to two, excepting that they then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then they shall complete their tasks and check them off the list, for they have followed the divine organizational commandment of three.
